        <p>Iâ€™m currently a data science major at 
            Simon Fraser University eager to gain more experience 
            as a data analyst, and future data scientist. 
            My goal is to be able to help others with the power of data! 
            <br/><br/>
            During my free time, you can find me getting hotpot with friends 
            (Big Way and Pot Empire are my second home) or daydreaming about my 
            next big trip! I love to learn and believe growth doesn't stop 
            after school! Right now, I'm learning Chinese and trying
            to build a stronger undestanding of the investing world.
