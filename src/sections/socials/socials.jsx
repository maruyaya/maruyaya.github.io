        <p>Iâ€™m currently a data science major at 
            Simon Fraser University eager to gain more experience 
            as a data analyst, and future data scientist. 
            My goal is to be able to help others with the power of data! 
            During my free time, you can find me getting hotpot with friends 
            (Big Way and Pot Empire are my second home) or struggling to 
            speak Chinese.
